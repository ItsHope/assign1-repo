            <p class="text">The paper Overview of Data Visualization introduces and defines the concept of data
                visualization by discussing different definitions from different people. Some definitions are
                shorter than others  but there is a general idea amongst all of them of what data
                visualization is. The general definition I got from engaging with the different definitions is
                that it is the idea of presenting findings visually for better understanding. These findings can
                be data or information. 
            </p>

            <p class="text"> The paper also makes an emphasis on the difference between data and information.Although depending 
                on context, data can be defined as “unprocessed information” while information can be defined as “processed data” 
                (Hey, 2004; Zins, 2007) as cited in Li, 2020.Data is raw, insignificant and has no meaning. Information is the data 
                that is now processed,collected, given meaning after all because of relational connection.
             </p>

             <p class="text">
                I think whether data is processed or unprocessed it can still take time to be understood or
                even understood at all, especially when presented to the average person who does not have
                a PhD in data science. This is why I think data visualization plays a crucial role in research. I
                also tend to create a mental image when I am offloaded with new information anyway. This
                perceptual process is discussed in detail in a chapter of the paper. 
            
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Li suggests, since humans create a mental representation of the environment around them,
                this is called human perception. There is a benefit to data visualization and this perception
                plays a huge role because when data is presented visually, humans use their visual
                perception to analyse, compare and judge shapes, colours and sizes. Preattentive theories
                are discussed to discuss human perception further. 
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Some examples of data visualizations include Scatter plots, Graphs, Trees, Charts, Diagrams,
                Tables, Waveform, Simulation and Volume (Li, 2020). These are defined and discussed in
                detail with figure examples. The paper emphasizes the importance of knowing which type of
                data visualization to use. There is so many to choose from but not all data needs to be
                presented with a bar graph. Other considerations are how, apart from the diagram itself
                (bar graph, pie chart) . You can communicate meaning through colour, shape and size to
                give relational connection. 

             </p>

             
             <p class="text">
                    The paper also addresses the relationship between data visualization and aesthetics.
                    Aesthetics, because of the perceptual process and preattentive processing theories, has
                    been identified as having value to data visualization. 

                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    In conclusion the paper aimed to define data visualization, terms related to the world of
data and give a sense of encouragement to consider data visualization when presenting
data. Raw data can be overwhelming. The world produces around roughly 2.5 quintillion
bytes of daily (Vuleta, 2022), David McCandless at a TedTalk described his experience of
working with data for a month that only fitted 2 pages at the end. “Data visualization is a
way of simplifying and making small, an enormous amount of information” (Candless, 2012).
I took away from this that, without data visualization it would almost be impossible to many
to make out meaning from general raw data. 
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    There is also an emphasis of good data visualization. Data can still not make sense even
when presented visually. This is an important point made. For good data visualization, it is
good to avoid clutter, ensure clear readability and meaning. It is also good to include
comparisons.

                    Through close reading and careful consideration of the readings listed below, discuss the relationships between Data Visualization, Data Art, and their strategies of Representation 

 

To introduce the discussion, I will define the respective terms. Data Visualization can be defined as the process of transforming raw data into graphs, charts, images and lately even videos. (Few, 2007). This transformation is a powerful way to present data and communicate to viewers what was discovered (the data).  

While on the other hand data art can be defined the same but the difference is that data art or data-driven art is made to convey a certain emotion to users, this is made usually through interaction. Both data visualizations and data driven artworks can have interactivity though, the difference is conveying information while the other conveys both information and art.  

 

This paper will also look at the theories of representation. Namely, Representation and reality; representation and visual culture; representation as persuasion; and representation and myth as well as representation and identity politics.  

 

On the topic of presenting information through visualization, I will discuss one of the theories of representation known as Representation and Visual Communication. Visual Communication is described as the transmission of information through imagery and symbols. Both Data Visualization and data art relate to this theory.  

 

My experience with this is that during the semester, when an assignment required a data visualization, my core goal would be to ensure that the bar graph, chart, etc. can be read. Does it make sense? Is the information I am trying to present clear?  

And if the assignment required an interactive data visualization, that to me meant the visualization would be static unless interacted with. Any form of movement would be because of the user's input, clicking, hovering, or dragging etc. The focus would be, through interaction, the user must be able to extract new information. The interaction is educational.  

 

While with my data art, I focused on interactivity more or animation to evoke emotions from the user. The interaction is emotional which is the beauty of it. Data visualization is education and data driven art is emotional (Rougeux, 2020).  

 

 

Both data art and data visualization have cons and benefit society in many ways. 

Data visualization without a doubt has elevated how people present information. Presenting for human beings is more important and complex than we can understand. "We live immersed in representation: it is how we understand our environments and each other. It is also how we both are, and how we understand ourselves; representation is implicated in the process of me becoming me" (Webb, 2009 as cited in Kidd, 2020).  

 

Data Art because of fields like Techno art is a powerful tool because of the emotional interaction. "Art contributes to making improvements in public deliberation concerning technological risks by enganging people in moral-emotional reflection"(Janssens, 2016)

                        <p class="text">The introduction of the paper explains how interaction has been a difficult concept to define in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction). Even though recently there has been a review, this is still unclear for a closely related field, "Visualization". "Problems with definitions are not unique to HCI"(Marshall, 2013). The word interaction alone is described more than twice as "an elusive and overloaded term" (Dimara and Perin, 2020). I agree with this because while attempting to do my own research on the concept I was met with the kind of ways you can interact with visualizations like brushing, scaling, painting etc.  
    
                        </p> 
    
                        
    
         
    
     
     
     
    
                    <p class="text">But nonetheless, over the years, there has been a rise in visualization systems with interactivity, systems that give the user the freedom to make changes to data visualizations, these changes like scaling mentioned above are minimum. The anticipated actions users can make in the future include being able to build visualizations from scratch, remove distracting information etc. This is a vision (Dimara and Perin, 2020).  
    
     
     
     
    
                    </p> 
    
     
     
    
                    <p class="text">Although technical challenges are a barrier for this vision, the authors argue that defining what interaction is in visualization is a part of the barrier. This paper aims to define what interaction is in visualization through extensive research and comparison. 
    
     
     
    
                        A part of this research was conducted through a critical review of interaction from the interaction community. They collected a list of papers, followed a methodology with the following requirements: (a)Expert input is needed regarding the view of interaction of the community, (b)the snowballing approach on its own will not suffice because of the bias from scratch with the selection of seed papers, and (c) HCI papers unrelated to visualization shall not be included(Dimara and Perin, 2020).  
    
                         
    
                     
    
                     
    
                    </p> 
    
                     
    
                    <p class="text">The authors give us a methodology rationale that discusses the metrics used to measure the relevance of papers. This rationale also includes the review of the questionnaire that was sent to visualization researchers. The methodology used to collect the papers is also discussed (tagging with themes), the respective tags are: (a) Critical on Interaction, (b) Definition of Interaction, (c) List, (d) Interactive Pipeline, (e) Interactive Pipeline and lasty, (f) Benefits of Interaction (Dimara and Perin, 2020).  
    
                     </p> 
    
     
     
    
                     <p class="text">There is summary of the review that includes specifications of the number of participants involved for the review, the number of people recruited as well as the number of both the linked and seed papers. In total there were 59 papers.  
    
                        Out of the 59 papers only 32 are definition papers, the common components drawn about what interaction looks like for visualization are namely external and internal actions, as well as external and internal entities. Because interaction for visualization can be set apart as a goal-oriented activity, its properties include granularity, multiple levels of granularity.  
    
                         
    
     
     
    
                    </p> 
    
     
     
     
    
                    <p class="text">Continuous vs Discrete, whether the entity of interaction is continuous or discrete. And lastly for the properties, directness, and indirectness.  
    
      
    
                        Another angle taken for research is words related to the term "interaction", these being the science of interaction, interactivity, and interaction technique. (Dimara and Perin, 2020)  
    
                         
    
                         
    
                        39 papers identified the benefits of interaction. Interaction can enhance understanding, amplify human drive exploration and the overall experience of in this case, analyzing data. "While visualizations may provoke curiosity, interaction provides the means to satisfy it"(Tomniski, 2020 as cited in Preim, 2020)  
    
                         
    
                         The papers also brought up a common theme that is the opposite of benefit, the frustrations around the concept of interaction. They also identified the need for flexible interaction systems.  
    
                         
    
     
     
    
                    </p> 
    
     
     
    
                    <p class="text">The list of papers also identified approaches needed to conceptualize interaction for the visualization community, these are task, human-centric and system.  
    
     
     
     
     
    
                        Finally, the paper summarizes the view of interaction in visualization, the conclusion details that interaction is "a dialogue between a human user and the visualization system over a central object of interest" (Dimara and Perin, 2020) but because there is a need in flexibility as mentioned before this causes limitations. To address these limitations, the paper focuses on interaction but in a different field, in the field of HCI (Dimara and Perin, 2020).  
    
                         
    
                         
    
                         
    
                         
    
                        "The View of HCI" is a similar paper to the view of interaction in visualization (Dimara and Perin, 2020), before comparing, the authors summarize the paper and are met with 7 components that characterize interaction in the field. These being Control, Experience, Embodiment, Optimal Behavior, Dialogue, Transmission and Tool Use (Dimara and Perin, 2020). The paper then discusses how the view of interaction in visualization can be extended through the lens of Human-Computer interaction.  
    
                         
    
                    </p> 
    
     
     
     
    
                    <p class="text"> This is the comparison part of the research, some differences between the two include user intent. User intent is irrelevant in HCI while it is not in visualization. The idea is that revealing how to use a tool may be executed as imposing on a user while this is completely different for visualization. User Profiling, HCI designs frequently encourage a transition from novice to expert use within the same tool while in visualization, the design study uses the method of creating user profiles from the start. Many other differences like entities at play, performance focus, nature of intent to name a few, are discussed.  
    
                         
    
                    </p> 
    
     
     
    
                    <p class="text"> So what is interaction for visualization after this extensive research and effort? " Interaction in the field of visualization is the interplay between a user and a data interface involving a data-related intent with at least one action from the user and an interface reaction that is perceived as such"(Dimara and Perin, 2020).  
    
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
    
                        In conclusion this paper did a respectable job doing a critical review of what interaction is in visualization, different angles were used for this research, and we saw that through the methodology rationale. Methodology rationales have become mandatory and necessary especially for an extensive research paper like this, this part of the paper I enjoyed engaging with. The view on the topic is not imposed, understanding is gained through comparisons made and decriptions.
