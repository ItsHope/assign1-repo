            <p class="text">The paper Overview of Data Visualization introduces and defines the concept of data
                visualization by discussing different definitions from different people. Some definitions are
                shorter than others  but there is a general idea amongst all of them of what data
                visualization is. The general definition I got from engaging with the different definitions is
                that it is the idea of presenting findings visually for better understanding. These findings can
                be data or information. 
            </p>

            <p class="text"> The paper also makes an emphasis on the difference between data and information.Although depending 
                on context, data can be defined as “unprocessed information” while information can be defined as “processed data” 
                (Hey, 2004; Zins, 2007) as cited in Li, 2020.Data is raw, insignificant and has no meaning. Information is the data 
                that is now processed,collected, given meaning after all because of relational connection.
             </p>

             <p class="text">
                I think whether data is processed or unprocessed it can still take time to be understood or
                even understood at all, especially when presented to the average person who does not have
                a PhD in data science. This is why I think data visualization plays a crucial role in research. I
                also tend to create a mental image when I am offloaded with new information anyway. This
                perceptual process is discussed in detail in a chapter of the paper. 
            
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Li suggests, since humans create a mental representation of the environment around them,
                this is called human perception. There is a benefit to data visualization and this perception
                plays a huge role because when data is presented visually, humans use their visual
                perception to analyse, compare and judge shapes, colours and sizes. Preattentive theories
                are discussed to discuss human perception further. 
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Some examples of data visualizations include Scatter plots, Graphs, Trees, Charts, Diagrams,
                Tables, Waveform, Simulation and Volume (Li, 2020). These are defined and discussed in
                detail with figure examples. The paper emphasizes the importance of knowing which type of
                data visualization to use. There is so many to choose from but not all data needs to be
                presented with a bar graph. Other considerations are how, apart from the diagram itself
                (bar graph, pie chart) . You can communicate meaning through colour, shape and size to
                give relational connection. 

             </p>

             
             <p class="text">
                    The paper also addresses the relationship between data visualization and aesthetics.
                    Aesthetics, because of the perceptual process and preattentive processing theories, has
                    been identified as having value to data visualization. 

                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    In conclusion the paper aimed to define data visualization, terms related to the world of
data and give a sense of encouragement to consider data visualization when presenting
data. Raw data can be overwhelming. The world produces around roughly 2.5 quintillion
bytes of daily (Vuleta, 2022), David McCandless at a TedTalk described his experience of
working with data for a month that only fitted 2 pages at the end. “Data visualization is a
way of simplifying and making small, an enormous amount of information” (Candless, 2012).
I took away from this that, without data visualization it would almost be impossible to many
to make out meaning from general raw data. 
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    There is also an emphasis of good data visualization. Data can still not make sense even
when presented visually. This is an important point made. For good data visualization, it is
good to avoid clutter, ensure clear readability and meaning. It is also good to include
comparisons.
