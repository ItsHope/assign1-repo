                Upon designing my home/landing page I decided on a dark page or rather the colour black as my main colour. This includes the colour black for the header/navbar as well as the body. All the text on my homepage is white because that is kind of the rule when you work with black. I know I could have chosen another bright colour but I did not want it to be too much of a contrast from the black.

             <p class="text">
                The rest of my pages are black too. I wanted to maintain good UI by being consistent with my design colours/choices. I wanted the pages to look like they belong to the same website, that was my focus because I have done that mistake before where my web pages had different colours and there was no consistency even down to the font.

                    I also strategically used colours, on the home page there are two colours used for the font. White
and Aqua. Aqua being the brightest or the colour that stands out from the black the most, I used
it on "significant" text like the title of my blogs. I also used it to on the "read more" text. This
text is significant because it is a button. This will let the user know its significance before
hovering over it to discover it is a button.

stuck to the conventional navbar on the top of the page. Logo on the top left of the page and all
my interface elements are elements a user has seen before.
From the feedback I have decided to also add a footer to all my pages to round them out, in that
way I will also be improving the UI and making my website feel familiar to modern everyday
websites.

functionality will be more appreciated on pages like the blog pages.

                        My prototype has this design, but I plan to change it for the next submission because of the
feedback I got. I also understand just how consistency is important for maintaining clarity from
the user and clarity pdf. The navbar on the homepage will be consistent all throughout my pages.
And since every page will have the same navabar, this will tick off one principle of the key
principles of UI and UX, allowing users' ways to reverse their actions easily. Instead of users
being able to access the design page and data visualization pages only from the homepage they
will have easy access irrespective of the page they are on.
I will implement rather, a sidebar of some sort on the blog pages or long pages that would cause
the user to scroll down for too long. This will help me accomplish my goal of wanting to give the
user easy access to all my blogs. This is one of the 6 key principles of UI and UX, allowing the
user to navigate easily via shortcuts.
