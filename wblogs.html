                <br>
                Main Colours
                <br>
                Upon designing my home/landing page I decided on a dark page or rather the colour black as my main colour. This includes the colour black for the header/navbar as well as the body. All the text on my homepage is white because that is kind of the rule when you work with black. I know I could have chosen another bright colour but I did not want it to be too much of a contrast from the black. 
            </p>

             <p class="text">
                The rest of my pages are black too. I wanted to maintain good UI by being consistent with my design colours/choices. I wanted the pages to look like they belong to the same website, that was my focus because I have done that mistake before where my web pages had different colours and there was no consistency even down to the font. 
                
                
            
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                The colours on my website are not black and white only. I also chose to include the aqua colour because I really wanted to mimic the dark mode of a coding studio. 
                <br>

                <br>

                I am still contemplating on whether I should add other bright colours.

                Icons
                <br>
            My website includes icons related to the text/button next to it. The navbar includes the list of, home, Blogs, design, data visualisation and design art. Home on the navbar includes the home icon. The book icon for the blogs and so fourth.

                Images 
                <br>
                All the images in my website are placed neatly in containers. The layout is thought through, including the size and shape. The pictures next to blogs are going to be related to the topic of the blog. I really made sure to get the pictures from "Unsplash free images" in the highest resolution, so that I could maintain a clean look thoughtrout my whole website.

                UX- 
                <br>
                My website is very familiar and that is what I wanted to achieve. A sense of familiarity for the user. I sticked to the conventional navbar on the top of the page. Logo on the top left of the page.

                    Navigation
                    <br>
                All the pages in my website have a scroll bar for better navigation. The navbar is sticky and is  customised for every page. The navbar on the blog pages has buttons that get a user to further down blogs like blog 6 faster. Without having to scroll down, a user can select the blog 6 button on the navbar. This is the same for the home page even though there are only 2 sections. This functionality will be more appreciated in pages like the blog pages.

                    <br>
                     
                For UX, the images on the home page are interactable when you hover over them. I plan to make this functionality consistent throughtout my pages. There is hovering all over the blog when a user interacts with a button.
