                    <h1>Design Rationale</h1>
                    <p class="webinfo"><em>
                        Because my website is an informative website, I knew that meant my website had to be simple and easy to look at, so the user does exactly what they need to do when they view my website, learn from it without getting distracted by animations and complicated layouts.  

  

To ensure this I quickly did my research and found things to consider when building an informative/newsletter type of website. These include; 

The colours you are going to use for your website. It is suggested that using one dominant color is enough and that is exactly what I did for my website. The main color for my website is black. I feel that black always gives a premium look and that silver/grey gives 

 off what tech looks like today. Most of our tech like smart phones usually have the range of three colours black, silver and white.  

After deciding on the main colour I knew immediately that I was meant to choose white for the text. My website does have white text, a white stroller, and white borders around the pictures to balance the rest of the colors out. 

  

The rest of the colors being aqua and other neon type colours. This made sense for me because I felt like my website mimicked the dark mode of a coding studio. This was ideal because my website is about a digital future and how people have been able to make money online because of technology and the internet. Code and programming are one of the tools used to build the digital world as we know it today. 

  

Another important thing considerd is layout.In Addition to content being beautiful, easy to read, good looking which is a requirement for all types of websites, especially for educational blogs, content has to be laid out in a clever way. The layout of the website is one of the first things a user notices when they land on a page. The layout will either make the user engage or be overwhelmed by the content. For my website, leaving white space between different components. Making use of borders and sections to lay out my content.

                    <h2>Rationale for Data Driven Art</h2>
                    <p class="webinfo"><em>My website speaks on ways to make money online and the positive impact of the internet. One of the newest phenomenas is the mystery of social media influencing and the rise of content creators.

                        Over the last few years we have seen social media figures live lavish lifestyles,with yachts and jets. Although part of it is lifestyle marketing some of it is genuine wealth. I think a lot of people including myself are always surprised when they find out how much influencers make.
                        
                        People were shocked when it was revealed that a famous beauty influencer Kylie Jenner makes over $1,000,000 per sponsor post. So for my data driven art I want to share a local influencers charge over the last few years, but with an element of mystery or a slow reveal. There will be buttons with years to interact with that slowly reveal some sort of data visualization ,be it a bar that slowly shoots up to reveal the amount.
                        
                        The whole data art page will consist of the content creators content with their videos and pictures placed creatively almost like how a digital album/collage.
